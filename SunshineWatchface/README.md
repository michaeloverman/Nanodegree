#Sunshine Watchface

This is the "Make it Ubiquitous" project. The starter files included the Sunshine weather app from the earlier courses, in its complete and functioning form. The assignment was to create a watchface to go with the app, which includes weather forcast data from the app, on the watch. Along with the time and date, of course.
